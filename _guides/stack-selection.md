# Technology Stack Selection

The key to successful AI coding agent development is choosing tech stacks that work well together and are well-understood by AI models. This guide helps you select proven combinations that minimize setup complexity and maximize development velocity.

## Stack Selection Framework

### 1. Requirements Analysis

Before choosing technologies, thoroughly understand your requirements:

#### Functional Requirements
- **Core Features**: What must the system do?
- **User Experience**: Performance, accessibility, mobile support
- **Integration Needs**: External APIs, legacy systems, third-party services
- **Data Requirements**: Structure, volume, relationships, compliance

#### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Reliability**: Uptime, error handling, disaster recovery
- **Maintainability**: Code organization, documentation, testing

#### Constraints
- **Time**: Development timeline and milestones
- **Budget**: Development and operational costs
- **Team**: Skills, experience, learning capacity

## Stack Validation Checklist

### Technical Validation
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Can the stack meet response time and throughput needs?
- [ ] **Scalability**: How will it handle growth in users and data?
- [ ] **Security**: Does it support required security features?
- [ ] **Integration**: Can it integrate with existing systems?
- [ ] **Data Requirements**: Does it handle your data volume and complexity?

### Team Validation  
- [ ] **Expertise**: Does the team have experience with these technologies?
- [ ] **Learning Curve**: How long to become productive?
- [ ] **Hiring**: Can you find developers with these skills?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is there good learning material available?
- [ ] **Community**: Is there active community support?

### Business Validation
- [ ] **Time to Market**: How quickly can you deliver?
- [ ] **Development Cost**: What's the resource investment?
- [ ] **Operational Cost**: What are the ongoing expenses?
- [ ] **Vendor Risk**: Are you too dependent on any single vendor?
- [ ] **Long-term Viability**: Will this technology be supported long-term?

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] **Single Points of Failure**: What happens if a key technology fails?
- [ ] **Migration Path**: How difficult would it be to change later?
- [ ] **Security Vulnerabilities**: What are the known risks?
- [ ] **Performance Bottlenecks**: Where might performance degrade?
- [ ] **Operational Complexity**: What's required to run this in production?

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Technology-Driven Decisions
❌ "Let's use Kubernetes because it's modern"
✅ "Let's evaluate if Kubernetes solves our scaling and deployment needs"

### Resume-Driven Development
❌ "I want to learn Rust, let's use it for this project"
✅ "Rust's performance benefits align with our high-throughput requirements"

### Following Hype Blindly
❌ "Everyone's using microservices, we should too"
✅ "Our team size and complexity justify microservices architecture"

### Over-Engineering
❌ Building for problems you don't have yet
✅ Starting simple and scaling complexity as needed

### Under-Engineering  
❌ Ignoring known future requirements
✅ Planning for reasonable growth and evolution

## Stack Evolution Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP/Prototype
- Choose familiar technologies
- Prioritize development speed
- Accept some technical debt
- Focus on validation

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit
- Address performance bottlenecks
- Improve security and reliability
- Add proper monitoring
- Refactor major pain points

### Phase 3: Scale
- Optimize for performance and cost
- Add redundancy and fault tolerance
- Implement proper DevOps practices
- Consider architectural changes

### Phase 4: Enterprise
- Add compliance and governance
- Implement advanced monitoring
- Create disaster recovery plans
- Document everything

## Conclusion

Technology stack selection is a strategic decision that impacts your project's success. Use this systematic approach:

1. **Understand Requirements** - Functional, non-functional, and constraints
2. **Evaluate Options** - Use the decision criteria matrix
3. **Validate Choices** - Technical, team, and business validation
4. **Plan Evolution** - How the stack will grow with your needs
5. **Document Decisions** - Record rationale for future reference

Remember: There's no perfect stack, only trade-offs. Choose the stack that best balances your current needs with future flexibility.
