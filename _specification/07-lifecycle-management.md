# Project Lifecycle Management

OSpec defines a structured lifecycle for projects from inception through long-term maintenance, with clear handoffs between agent roles and human oversight points.

## Lifecycle Phases

### 1. Specification Phase

**Role**: Specifier Agent + Human Stakeholder

**Activities**:
- Convert requirements to OSpec YAML
- Define acceptance criteria
- Select technology stack
- Configure guardrails
- Set up secret providers

**Outputs**:
- Valid OSpec document
- Initial context prompts
- Secret configuration

**Quality Gates**:
- Specification validates against schema
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Security guardrails defined
- All required secrets identified

```yaml
# Example specification metadata
metadata:
  phase: "specification"
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  specifier: "human+ai"
  stakeholders:
    - role: "product_owner"
      contact: "team@company.com"
    - role: "tech_lead"
      contact: "tech@company.com"
```

### 2. Planning Phase

**Role**: Planner Agent

**Activities**:
- Decompose outcome into tasks
- Identify dependencies
- Estimate complexity
- Plan implementation phases
- Define checkpoint criteria

**Outputs**:
- Task breakdown structure
- Dependency graph
- Implementation timeline
- Risk assessment

**Quality Gates**:
- All acceptance criteria covered
- Dependencies mapped
- Resource requirements identified
- Risk mitigation planned

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: "setup-project"
    phase: "foundation"
    dependencies: []
    estimated_hours: 2
    priority: "critical"
    
  - id: "implement-auth"
    phase: "core"
    dependencies: ["setup-project"]
    estimated_hours: 8
    priority: "high"
    
  - id: "add-ui-components"
    phase: "features"
    dependencies: ["implement-auth"]
    estimated_hours: 12
    priority: "medium"
```

### 3. Implementation Phase

**Role**: Implementer Agent + Reviewer

**Activities**:
- Execute planned tasks
- Write and test code
- Run security scans
- Generate documentation
- Create deployment artifacts

**Outputs**:
- Working software
- Test suites
- Security reports
- Documentation
- Deployment configuration

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests pass
- Security scans clear
- Acceptance criteria met
- Code review approved

```yaml
# Implementation tracking
implementation:
  started: "2024-01-16T09:00:00Z"
  completed: "2024-01-20T17:00:00Z"
  tasks_completed: 15
  tasks_total: 18
  tests_passing: 142
  tests_total: 145
  security_issues: 0
  coverage_percentage: 87
```

### 4. Validation Phase

**Role**: Reviewer Agent + Human Approver

**Activities**:
- Execute acceptance tests
- Validate against requirements
- Perform final security review
- User acceptance testing
- Performance validation

**Outputs**:
- Test results
- Security clearance
- Performance metrics
- Approval documentation

**Quality Gates**:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Security review passed
- Performance requirements met
- Human approval obtained

### 5. Deployment Phase

**Role**: Implementer Agent + Operations

**Activities**:
- Deploy to production
- Configure monitoring
- Set up alerts
- Document operations procedures
- Verify live system

**Outputs**:
- Live system
- Monitoring dashboards
- Alert configurations
- Operations runbook

**Quality Gates**:
- Deployment successful
- Health checks passing
- Monitoring active
- Rollback plan ready

### 6. Maintenance Phase

**Role**: Human Team + Support Agents

**Activities**:
- Monitor system health
- Apply security updates
- Performance optimization
- Feature enhancements
- Bug fixes

**Outputs**:
- System updates
- Performance reports
- Security patches
- Enhancement plans

## State Management

### Project State Tracking

```yaml
# Project state document
project_state:
  current_phase: "implementation"
  overall_progress: 65
  
  phases:
    specification:
      status: "completed"
      completed_at: "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"
      artifacts:
        - "project.ospec.yaml"
        - "secrets.config.yaml"
    
    planning:
      status: "completed"
      completed_at: "2024-01-16T08:00:00Z"
      artifacts:
        - "tasks.yaml"
        - "dependencies.yaml"
    
    implementation:
      status: "in_progress"
      started_at: "2024-01-16T09:00:00Z"
      progress: 83
      current_tasks:
        - "implement-user-dashboard"
        - "add-data-export"
```

### Handoff Protocols

Each phase transition requires explicit handoff with validation:

```yaml
handoffs:
  specification_to_planning:
    triggers:
      - "spec_validation_passed"
      - "stakeholder_approval"
    requirements:
      - "valid_ospec_document"
      - "defined_acceptance_criteria"
      - "configured_guardrails"
  
  planning_to_implementation:
    triggers:
      - "task_breakdown_approved"
      - "dependencies_resolved"
    requirements:
      - "complete_task_list"
      - "resource_allocation"
      - "risk_assessment"
```

## Quality Assurance

### Continuous Validation

Throughout the lifecycle, continuous validation ensures quality:

1. **Specification Validation**
   - Schema compliance
   - Completeness checks
   - Consistency verification

2. **Implementation Validation**
   - Code quality metrics
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Security scan results

3. **Deployment Validation**
   - Health check verification
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security posture assessment

### Rollback Procedures

Each phase includes rollback procedures for failure scenarios:

```yaml
rollback_procedures:
  implementation_failure:
    - "revert_to_last_known_good"
    - "notify_stakeholders"
    - "analyze_failure_cause"
    - "update_risk_assessment"
  
  deployment_failure:
    - "execute_rollback_plan"
    - "restore_previous_version"
    - "verify_system_health"
    - "conduct_post_incident_review"
```

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Specification Quality**: Clarity, completeness, testability scores
- **Planning Accuracy**: Estimate vs actual duration, dependency prediction
- **Implementation Quality**: Test coverage, bug density, security score
- **Deployment Success**: Uptime, performance metrics, rollback frequency
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Response time, resolution rate, update frequency

### Progress Reporting

Automated progress reports provide stakeholders with regular updates:

```yaml
# Weekly progress report structure
progress_report:
  week: "2024-W03"
  overall_status: "on_track"
  completion_percentage: 65
  
  milestones:
    - name: "Authentication System"
      status: "completed"
      completed_ahead_of_schedule: "2 days"
    
    - name: "User Dashboard"
      status: "in_progress"
      expected_completion: "2024-01-22"
      blockers: []
  
  metrics:
    velocity: "12 story_points/week"
    defect_rate: "0.02 bugs/feature"
    test_coverage: "87%"
    security_score: "A+"
```
